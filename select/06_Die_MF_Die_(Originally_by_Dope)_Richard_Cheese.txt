Die
Ahh
I don't need your forgiveness
I don't need your hate
I don't need your acceptance
So, what should I do?
I don't need your resistance
I don't need your prayers
I don't need your religion
I don't need a thing from you
I'll be sorry when I'm old
You're so full of shit man
Just go
Die, motherfucker, die, motherfucker, die
Die, motherfucker, die, motherfucker, die
Die, motherfucker, die, motherfucker, die
Die, motherfucker, die, motherfucker, die
Say, I don't need your prison
I don't need your pain
I don't need your decision
So, what should I do?
I'll be sorry so you've said
I'm not sorry
Bang, you're dead
Die, motherfucker, die, motherfucker, die
Die, motherfucker, die, motherfucker, die
Die
Die
Die
Die
